# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project

This project is part of AiCore.

The project is as follows:

1) Use TeachableMachine (https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to train a model to recognise an individual playing Rock Paper Scissors
2) Use this model in your code, and generate a function to play a rock paper scissors game

There is a limitation to the model that has been trained, in that it was trained on limited data (same person, same light, same background).
If others try to play the game, it may well not provide an accurate interpretation of rock/paper/scissors.
Further training of the model is required.
